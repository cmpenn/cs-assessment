insert times:
extraLargeArray- 945.7025ms
largeArray- 9.0216ms
mediumArray- 168.4us
smallArray- 53.9us
tinyArray- 89.5us


append times:
extraLargeArray- 4.4858ms
largeArray- 554.3 us (I don't know what the hell that is but I'm assuming it's faster than ms)
mediumArray- 148.7 us
smallArray- 202us
tinyArray- 399.5us 

The pattern that I see is that as the array gets the larger the better the append gets. at the start insert was faster but once the mediumArray was reached insert began to slow down a lot in compairson to the insert function. SO the function that scales better is the append function.
